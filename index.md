## ClockIn - Hourly Wage & Pay Tracking 

### Privacy Policy

This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the ClockIn for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.

#### Data Collected
The data you enter into ClockIn, such as jobs or entries, stays on your device and in any personal backups you create, such as a cloud backup of your phone. This information is not collected by us or transmitted to us or to any other party besides the company where your backups are stored.

#### Ads and Analytics

ClockIn displays advertising from Google Admob. Google Admob uses your advertising identifier (iOS Advertising ID or Android Advertising ID) to serve personalized ads based on the users interests (which includes collecting and analyzing user data). For more details on what Google Admob collects and uses, refer to Google's privacy policy.
You can reset your advertising identifier on iOS and Android. Additionally, Google Admob allows you to opt-out of personalized advertising. Note that if you upgrade from Free Edition to Personal Edition or better, no ads will be displayed and data will no longer be shared with Google Admob.

ClockIn also collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features or which system software version they are using, to help improve the app.

#### Usage
We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.
We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish the App's functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many time entries are created per month in the app.
